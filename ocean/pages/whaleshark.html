               Whale sharks live and roam in all oceans across the world. Their massive size prevents them from being prey (but of course humans ruin everything). A whale shark’s diet consists primarily of plankton, as they are feeder animals. They can eat up to 46 pounds of plankton a day as juveniles (that’s a lot). And they have cool spots on them, of course.
